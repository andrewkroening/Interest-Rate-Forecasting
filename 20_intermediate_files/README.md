## This directory contains the intermediate files used in the project

**Contents:**

The following files are the intermediate files used in the project, and are stored in the main directories for each experiment branch. The top 2 performing models are in the main, all other files are in the `_backup` directory:

* `rate_model(forecast)_100_1` - A `.pkl` file containing the model, and a `.csv` containing the results of the `rates_only` model trained with a 100-day anchor and 1-day forecast horizon.

* `rate_model(forecast)_100_29` - A `.pkl` file containing the model, and a `.csv` containing the results of the `rates_only` model trained with a 100-day anchor and 30-day forecast horizon.

* `rate_model(forecast)_756_252` - A `.pkl` file containing the model, and a `.csv` containing the results of the `rates_only` model trained with a 756-day anchor and 252-day forecast horizon.

* `rate_model(forecast)_1008_2519` - A `.pkl` file containing the model, and a `.csv` containing the results of the `rates_only` model trained with a 1008-day anchor and 2520-day forecast horizon.

* `rate_model(forecast)_504_29` - A `.pkl` file containing the model, and a `.csv` containing the results of the `rates_only` model trained with a 504-day anchor and 30-day forecast horizon.

* `rate_model(forecast)_2520_2519` - A `.pkl` file containing the model, and a `.csv` containing the results of the `rates_only` model trained with a 2520-day anchor and 2520-day forecast horizon.
